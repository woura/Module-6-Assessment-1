                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
<p>The Kordofan giraffe (G. c. antiquorum) has a distribution which includes southern Chad, the Central African Republic, northern Cameroon, and the northeastern DR Congo.Populations in Cameroon were formerly included in G. c. peralta, but this was incorrect.Compared to the Nubian giraffe, this subspecies has smaller and more irregular spotting patterns. Its spots may be found below the hocks and the insides of the legs. A median lump is present in males: 51–52  Some 2,000 are believed to remain in the wild.Considerable confusion has existed over the status of this subspecies and G. c. peralta in zoos. In 2007, all alleged G. c. peralta in European zoos were shown to be, in fact, G. c. antiquorum.With this correction, about 65 are kept in zoos.The formerly recognised subspecies G. c. congoesis is now considered part of the Kordofan giraffe.</p>
<p>The circulatory system of the giraffe has several adaptations for its great height. Its heart, which can weigh more than 11 kg (25 lb) and measures about 60 cm (2 ft) long, must generate approximately double the blood pressure required for a human to maintain blood flow to the brain. As such, the wall of the heart can be as thick as 7.5 cm (3.0 in).</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE DO YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Where do giraffes live? Most giraffes live in grasslands and open woodlands in East Africa, especially in reserves such as the Serengeti National Park and the Amboseli National Park. Some are also found in the reserves of Southern Africa.</p>
