                    <h3>LOST FOREST</h3>
                    <p>The Lost Forest isn't hard to find â€” it's just hard to see. Tucked in among the trees and rocks at Elk Camp on Snowmass are an alpine coaster, biking trails, ropes challenges and a climbing wall. There are ponds to fish in, creeks to hike along and places to enjoy nature alone or with the whole family.</p> 
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</p></strong>
                    <p>The Lost Woods is within the Woodland Tower region, which is directly north of Hyrule Castle, or alternatively, north of Lanayru Wetlands (which itself is north of Kakariko Village). It's not essential, we recommend activating the Woodland Tower to help flesh out your map and guide you for where you need to go.</p>
