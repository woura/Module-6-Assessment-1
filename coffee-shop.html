                    <h3>WILD THINGS COFFEE SHOP</h3>
                    <p>A coffeehouse, coffee shop, or caf√© is an establishment that primarily serves coffee of various types, e.g. espresso, latte, and cappuccino. ... A coffeehouse may share some of the same characteristics of a bar or restaurant, but it is different from a cafeteria.</p> 
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</p></strong>
                    <p>If you're targeting employees on their way to work, opening your coffee shop in a family-friendly shopping center might cause your business to struggle in sales even if the location generates a lot of foot traffic. You'd be better off opening in an area close to an office park or in a business district.</p>
